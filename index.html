  <h2>How this problem affects people and the economy</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>This problem affects people because there is either a low working economy or no work in the economy. Without work the economy can't function. The basic essentials of life are food, water and power and without work the economy won't be able to produce these basic Essentials. like No work flow means no power, food, water or money to get these essentials.
<h2>A possible solution, and how people can solve this problem</h2>

 1. A way people can help solve this problem is to hire more people, so there is more jobs in the economy. Once there is more workflow everyone will eventually expand, Employment rates will raise, and the economy will grow.
